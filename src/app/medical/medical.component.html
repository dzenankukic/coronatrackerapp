  <h2>COVID-19</h2>
  </strong>
  <p class="text-left mt-2">
  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus, or COVID, is a contagious
  disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known
  case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide,
  leading to an ongoing pandemic.

  Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing
   difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after
   exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable
   symptoms. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients,
   most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe
   symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical
   symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk
   of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID)
   for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway
   to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
